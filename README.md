# Weather Dashboard

## Description 

This is a weather dashboard application that uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities, and uses `localStorage` to store persistent data, while featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## Functionality

When a user opens the application for the first time, a search bar is displayed where they can search for weather by city.

Weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index, for a searched city is presented and a 5-day forecast is also displayed.

Past searches are also saved and populated within the sidebar, allowing the user to select past searched cities.
